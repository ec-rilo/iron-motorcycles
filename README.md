## Features
This app has many features, it comes with:

- A fully responsive website ranging from mobile view to desktop
- A cart menu where the user can see items they have added to the cart as well as their respective prices,
item quantity control, and cart subtotal. All items stored in localStorage for data persistence.
- Dynamic motorcycle category selection
- Contact Page
- Cart checkout page where the user can get a final view of their cart before making a purchase of all items in cart.

## Motivation and Story
This project was a highly anticipated project of mine - being able to create a nice mock of an e-commerce site that had
dynamic page creation and item control was the goal for this project. I had lots of practice with react-router as well as
being exposed to other technologies such as react-scroll, and more react hooks such as useContext. I also ended up using some
functions from the Math object (as well as using other functions) in order to be able to calculate the subtotal of multiple cart
items. Lots of practice with commonly used react tech such as useState and passing props was done throughout the project.

All components were created using functional components.
